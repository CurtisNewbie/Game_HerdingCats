# Game_HerdingCats 

It's a game called Herding cats.

<h2> Game rules </h2>

The game involves 10 Cats and one Dog. The Cats and Dog are each located
in one particular square on each turn of the game. The player controls the Dog,
and the Cats move (mostly) in response to the Dog's position.

The game starts with the 10 Cats randomly distributed across the grid. On
each turn the player enters a number and the Dog is moved to that square, and the 
cats respond to the dag's movements. The way cats respond based on their rules. 

Each cat is assigned a specific rule:
<ul>
  <li>The cat moves away from the dog.</li>
  <li>The cat move beside the dog, i.e., it will move to a square that is adjacent to its previous square and to the dog's square. </li>
  <li>No matter how the cat moves, it will stay stil if it reaches the edge of the window. </li>
</ul>

The goal of the game is to herd the Cats into a single square. It doesn't
matter which square, once all the Cats are in one square the player wins the
game. :D

<h2> Issues that need to be solved </h2>

<ol>
<li>I have written some basic algorithm to allow the user to change the size of the window of the game. The cats and dogs will remain at the relative positions that they are supposed to be. However, you should not 'full screen' the game, as it may results in weired phenomenon. I will fix it as soon as possible. </li>

<li>Further, I will replace the ugly 'D' and 'C' symbols using images in the future. Please forgive me, lol.</li>
</ol>

<h2> How to control the game </h2>

You will need to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the dog 'D', i.e., up, down, left, right keys on the keyboard.
