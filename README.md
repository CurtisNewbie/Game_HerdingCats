# Game_HerdingCats
It's a game called Herding cats. [Last modifed on 2018/11/11 ]

The game involves 10 Cats and one Dog. The Cats and Dog are each located
in one particular square on each turn of the game. The player controls the Dog,
and the Cats move (mostly) in response to the Dog's position.
The game starts with the 10 Cats randomly distributed across the grid. On
each turn the player enters a number and the Dog is moved to that square, and the 
cats respond to the dag's movements.

The object of the game is to herd the Cats into a single square. It doesn't
matter which square, once all the Cats are in one square the player wins the
game.

This is an assignment of one of my COM module. It's just a game, using a package 
provided by the lecturer. Unfortunately, I should not provide the package due to the 
copyright. I will update it using Swing in the future.
